                                     What do you gain confident and lack of confident?
         When I was in my fifth year of primary school, one day my teacher told me there was a Model Airplane competition held in downtown of the city a month’s later, because my teacher, Henry, knew I was quite interested in building something and airplane. After I came home, I told my dad this thing, and said I was going to make a remote controlled aircraft to win this competition. Undoubtedly, my father was so happy and supported me to compete this game. At the same time, he said “ of course I will support you to do such a meaningful thing, but there are one thing you have to promise me that is you can’t give up on the halfway. If you don’t have enough confident to finish the airplane, I afraid that I won’t let you to do it at the first beginning. All right?” “Absolutely, I will stick to the goal no matter what” I said.
           At the second day, I started to consider the possibilities that I would face in the process of making the airplane and how I deal with them. At first, I had to make a plan about all the details. For instance, what material I should use to build the plane, how could I make it works and what’s the structure and shape of the plane that could ensure it fly faster and make a turn flexibly.
         Therefore, every day, after the school, I read a lot of books, which are related to the dynamics and circuit, and when I was in trouble about some theory, I would turn to my dad and ask him to explain to me in a way that was easier to understand. Each time, when I asked for help from my dad, he always told me “ it doesn’t matter my son, we can figure it out.” And he always sat beside me until I go to sleep at about 1 am the other, but he still needed to go to work at 7 am. 
      At first s step I really made the plane, I thought that I needed to design the circuit, so the primary thing was to make the circuits worked. So, I took apart my controlled car and have a look its circuit’s theory. Later, I bought all part of the circuit from the electronic store, and built it. However, for cars, there are four wheels, but only need one engine. For airplane, there are at least three propellers one on the back the other on two sides separately, which means require three engines. So, I had to refit the whole circuit that could fit the aircraft. I tried over and over again, but my circuit still couldn’t work. At this moment, I began getting sad and feeling hopeless and started to cry at home, even wanted to quit this job. My dad came across to me and asked with a confused look on his face “ what’s going on my dear, could you tell me? “ “ I wanted to make me circuit to run, but after I tried a lot of times, it still couldn’t work.” I said with tears. “ Look! Do you remember what I said at the day you told me want to win this competition? I said you couldn’t lose your heart when you are facing some issues. Ok, right now, let me check the circuit with you, and find out where are the problems!” he guided me to check the every single part of the circuit hand by hand, just like the Robert, who is the character in Raymond Carver’s Cathedral, always encourage me to make it work and never give up. Finally, we did it, and the problem was I misconnected the wire in a wrong place.
      At the second step, I was going to choose a kind of material that is medium heavy to build the body, because if the plane was too light, it would disturb by the wind easily, but if the plane was too heavy, maybe it couldn’t take off. So, I tried several materials such as, wood, polyfoa, plastics and polyester resin.  So, I made the body with each kind of materials four in total. After put my circuit into each body and tried, I found that the body, which was made of by polyester resin, was most stable and fast. So, I decided to use this material.
        Finally, I made a new body with polyester resin, which was perfectly refit and with a beautiful painting on the cover. On the match day, I controlled this aircraft, which contain two men’s painstaking effect, win the first prize. Eventually, I reached my goal and gain confident with the help of my father. And, I learned that no matter what, we can’t give up at any time of our life.
